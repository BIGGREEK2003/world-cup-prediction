# World Cup Winner Prediction

This notebook uses historical team and player statistics to predict World Cup outcomes using machine learning.  
It’s part of my journey into data science and sports analytics, where I combine real-world datasets with predictive modeling to uncover insights and trends.

## ⚽ What This Project Covers
- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation using pandas and NumPy
- 🧠 Feature engineering (xG totals, clearance dominance, minutes played, etc.)
- 🌲 Model training using Random Forest to predict win probabilities
- 📊 Visualizations of team strengths and prediction outputs

## 💡 Why I Built This
As a front-end developer expanding into machine learning, I wanted to apply my skills to a domain I love — football.  
This project helped me sharpen:
- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation
- Technical storytelling for LinkedIn and GitHub

## 📁 Files Included
- `world-cupwinner.ipynb` — main notebook with analysis and predictions
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies for running the notebook
- `README.md` — project overview

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add player-level features and match-level predictions
- Compare multiple models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Deploy the model with a simple web interface
- Share insights and visuals on LinkedIn and GitHub
