# World Equipment Analysis

This notebook explores military equipment data across multiple countries using Python and pandas.  
It’s part of my broader journey into data science and machine learning, where I apply real-world datasets to uncover patterns and build insights.

## 🔍 What This Project Covers
- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation using pandas and NumPy
- 📊 Comparative analysis of tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles
- 📈 Visual insights into regional military capacity using matplotlib and seaborn
- 🧠 Feature engineering for future predictive modeling

## 💡 Why I Built This
As a front-end developer expanding into data science, I wanted to work with geopolitical datasets to sharpen my skills in:
- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visual storytelling with Python

This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing how I blend technical precision with meaningful insights.

## 📁 Files Included
- `world_equipment.ipynb` — main notebook with analysis
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies for running the notebook
- `README.md` — project overview

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add predictive modeling to estimate regional military strength
- Integrate external datasets (e.g., GDP, population) for deeper context
- Share visualizations on LinkedIn and GitHub
